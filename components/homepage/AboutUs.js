        <p>
          Founded in 2021, DeCharity was created to be a voice for people.
          According to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE),
          approximately $40 billion is lost to non-profit fraud loss annually.
          DeCharity was created to increase the real-time tracking of both
          income and spending of the people who create them. Utilizing
          revolutionary blockchain technology, people can be assured that their
          money is safe and their transactions are protected.
          <br /> <br />
          DeCharity was designed to be a platform that everyone can trust; the
          creator and each individual supporter. We wanted to ensure that people
          knew exactly where their money was going and it would encourage
          creators to remain in contact with their supporters to complete their
          cause.
